Wildebeest Text Editor
====================== 

####INTRODUCTION
This is a text editor coded entirely in python.It's more like a personal project to help me in quickly developing webpages or testing some experiments of css,html and javascript. However you can use it for day to day web development or for playing around with js,css and html.It's like JSFIDDLE right on your machine. Feel free to email me if you need any kind of assistance in using the product.

####FEATURES
- Syntax highlighting
- Zencoding support.
- No need to write initial markup.That's wildebeest's work.
- Write only needed things.
- Integrated Shell
- No need to switch tabs
- Check your webpages while developing in real time(that's the reason behind it's development)

####HOW TO USE
If you've used any online code fiddlers like [CODEPEN](http://codepen.io) or [JSFIDDLE](http://jsfiddle.net) then you won't face any problem in using the product.Simply fire up the app by issuing "python editor.py" in the terminal.
Just write your code.The editor will write all other redundant code like combining scripts,styles and html files together for your page.Now this will create a folder named "project" in your wildebeest editor's directory just go inside that folder and open "webfile.html" and your page is up.

The editor adds an auto reloading javascript function to your page so that you can see your page's development in real time(I know that's a trick).
The "do" button saves the code to files so it is neccessary to press it after making any changes to your code.

If you want to stop the auto reloading of page so that you can check the javascript,just check the check box named "check javascript" then press "do" and you're done.The page will not auto reload anymore.If you want it to do auto reloading again simply uncheck the check box,press "do" and manually reload the page only one time.TA DA!....your page is autoreloading now.

#####NOTES
- It introduces "autoreload.js" file into your project.So remove that file after you're done with development.
